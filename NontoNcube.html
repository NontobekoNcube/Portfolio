    <h3>About Me!</h3>
    I love working with people, and inspiring them to be the best version of
    themselves. <br />
    I am a personal development geek, but also love being creative and <br />
    colourful on the web. I enjoy playing with data, and the reasoning and logic
    that goes into ensuring that decisions are the best possible decisions
    possible.
