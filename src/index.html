        Thank you for stopping by! I’m an optimistic and creative front-end web
        developer with a passion for bringing ideas to life through design. My
        journey into web development started when I met my mentor on Focusmate,
        who has been an incredible guide along the way. Now, I specialize in
        understanding my clients’ needs, even when they’re not sure how to
        articulate them, and transforming those ideas into intuitive, beautiful
        and purposeful designs. Whether you’re looking to simplify complex
        concepts or bring a new vision to the web, you can trust that your
        project is in good hands. Outside of coding, I’m a plant mom, an
        experimenting cook, and an avid runner and reader—each of these passions
        keep me energized and inspired. Together, they make me the best person
        to tackle your next project!
