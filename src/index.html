        Hello there! Thank you for stopping by! I'm an optimistic and creative
        front-end web developer with a passion for bringing ideas to life
        through design. My journey into web development started when I met my
        mentor on Focusmate, who has been an incredible guide along the way.
        Now, I specialize in understanding my clients' needs, even when they're
        not sure how to articulate them, and transforming those ideas into
        intuitive, beautiful and purposeful designs. Whether you're looking to
        simplify complex concepts or bring a new vision to the web, you can
        trust that your project is in good hands. Outside of coding, I'm a plant
        mom, an experimenting cook, and an avid runner and readerâ€”each of these
        passions keep me energized and inspired. Together, they make me the best
        person to tackle your next project!
